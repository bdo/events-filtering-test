# Technical test

## Summary

The exercise consists in developing a client-side React page that takes as input at least:
- a Github stream URL (such as https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/events or https://api.github.com/events)
- a pair of dates

This page should display these events in a table, and filter them according to the inputs (e.g. between two dates).

## Requirements

- Written in React
- Use Redux
- Tested
- Each state should be global

The code you will produce is part of our technical interview process. You'll own obviously property on everything you will produce.
